Are any of these super fun and pleasant thoughts resonating? This is obviously too long to respond to with expedience. Maybe that was no accident. I'm fine if it gets cut, there's no need to answer. I'm just having early career complex feelings about what the "next step" should be -- in a time when the whole industry is asking the same question.

1. Exciting AR things! I used to feel anxious that most of our "AR" has largely been sound-based (audio stories draped over found spaces), but now I'm enjoying diving deeper into the form -- looking at player-operated sound in podplays (on-screen buttons, dials, recording, sampling, playback, etc). I'm also definitely pumped to someday use AR target markers in Play Fail Win for cued textboxes, sound, and dialogue -- like a real RPG! Speaking of... 

2. The HUD in PFW is purposefully generic, aesthetically drawn from 90's and 00's dungeon-crawlers with an ethos inspired by Portal, Dear Esther, and The Stanley Parable. Oh and this weird part-live-action Myst-esque adventure game from 1997 that scarred me as a child. You can see the HUD for yourself too; our last stream was one of the more interesting ones I think. Have you used a HUD in any of your shows?

3. We haven’t actually played with any haptics yet at *It’s Not A Box Theatre* but I’m looking at these gloves and this vest for haptic-based player input to a performer. Keeping tabs on sensory-substitution tech like this thing -- think sound-to-movement! What kinds of player-control of performers have you found success with, other than voice commands? 

4. Glorious and insightful failure: realizing that we put no distance limit on when players are allowed to give the "fast travel" command, resulting in me running full tilt as an obedient avatar until I could not. Also there was a build of the game that ironically told the player to only do "Cool" tasks and none of the "Not Cool" tasks but they didn't take the bait, leaving the entire story we wrote completely untouched.

I've actually been in touch w/ [DopoLavoro Teatrale (DLT)](https://www.dltexperience.com/) since the spring when they were doing Theatre On Call. I was going to be a guest on their show but company mandate re-writing and *Play Fail Win* took precedence! Any other collaborators or mentors or schools you'd recommend? I was looking at Concordia University's Intermedia MFA, U of A's Theatre Practice MFA, and OCAD's Interdisciplinary MFA (tho I'm hesitant to pay Toronto rent just to take up coding and further divide my time-pie).
